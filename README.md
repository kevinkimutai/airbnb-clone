# Airbnb Clone

Welcome to my Airbnb clone project! This web application is built using Next.js, NextAuth for authentication, MongoDB for data storage, and Prisma as the database toolkit.

The Airbnb Clone is a replica of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb. It allows users to browse and search for accommodations, view details about listings, and book their stay. Here's what you can expect from this project:

- **Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely using NextAuth.
- **Search and Browse**: Search for available accommodations, view listings, and filter results based on various criteria.
- **Booking**: Users can make reservations for their desired dates and view their booking history.
- **Host Features**: Hosts can list their properties, manage bookings, and update their listings.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be mobile-responsive for a seamless user experience.
